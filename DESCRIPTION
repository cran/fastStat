Description: When we do statistic work, we need to see the structure of the data.
    list.str() function will help you see the structure of the data quickly. 
    list.plot() function can help you check every variable in your dataframe.
    table_one() function will make it easy to make a baseline table including 
    difference tests. uv_linear(), uv_logit(), uv_cox(), uv_logrank() will give
    you a hand to do univariable regression analysis, while mv_linear(), 
    mv_logit() and mv_cox() will carry out multivariable regression analysis.
